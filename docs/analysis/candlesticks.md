# Candlesticks

[A Primer on Candlesticks](https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/japanese-candlestick-trading-guide-200615)

The `Candlestick` class is derived from the `Ohlc` class and contains properties for most of the single candle indicators.
The prevalent single-candle pattern that is missing from the `Candlestick` class is the "Tall Light/Dark Candle."
It is absent because "tall" is a relative term and requires knowledge of previous candles to be determined.
