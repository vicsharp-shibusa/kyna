﻿/*
 * WARNING
 * 
 * The EOD historical data code is no longer supported.
 * This code remains because there is a ton of it, but it is no longer supported.
 * It compiles, of course, but there may be reason to think it will not work as expected.
 * Many changes were made to the system (especially the data access layer), but I was unable
 * to test these changes because I no longer have an active eodhd.com account.
 * I've pretty much switched to using polygon.io.
